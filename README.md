!["And I will give him
Kardamyle. 
Great men live there, and flocks are there beyond counting,
and he shall have them all, and its people shall honor him like a god,
with gifts beneath his sceptre and justice under his rule."](https://w28n27r522.ufs.sh/f/QWcLH3qd5jMxp061y3hSKNGoMFsgw5jBvAJE6fmTLYUxZydX)
